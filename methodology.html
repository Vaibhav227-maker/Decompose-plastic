            <h1 class="blue">Methodology of Prototyping</h1>
            <p class="white"><b>In this section, we will explain the step-by-step methodology we followed to create our prototype for the Plastic Decomposer Drone.</b></p>
            
            <h2 class="blue">Step 1: Research and Analysis</h2>
            <p class="white"><b>We started with in-depth research on plastic types and their environmental impact. Based on this, we analyzed the requirements for our decomposer drone. We hgave collected all the types of data on regarding of plastic waste and their accomodation in landfills. These are been displayed in the page of Data and Statistics Page. We are also trying to collect dats for our AI integration to split Water applied Plastic and with no water plastics. This Ai would integrate and follow all the AI ethics by modern UN nation Sustainable Goals.</b></p>
            
            <h2 class="blue">Step 2: Design and Development</h2>
            <p class="white"><b>Our design phase focused on making the drone lightweight while ensuring enough power for collecting plastic waste. I am also trying to create an 3D design of a drone which is super light weight and with so many compartmnets for decomposing Process. Not only Just the commpartment work but also with Circuit part storage and also with a Super large compartment holding a 10kg of Plastics. This also can effectively control with some large scale motors for making control a good one. This remote also has many features to identify and collect plastic with a FOV based camera o identify perfect components.</b></p>
            
            <h2 class="blue">Step 3: Prototype Testing</h2>
            <p class="white"><b>The prototype must be tested under a humid and all kind of weathery includes all conditions like Rainy, Cold and sunny. I have full confideence on test. This test would be done first on a small scale including just 200 grams of plastic. Then this project would be extended to a large scale slowly. This one not only has effect on plastic pollution but also heavily impacts on Water pollution, Soil Pollution and even Air pollution will be significantly controlled by this project. The prototype would be done within a few times. the model would be a significant solution involving portability compatibility.</b></p>
