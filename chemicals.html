            <h1 class="blue">Chemical Equations and Reactions</h1>
            <p class="white">We are trying to create a drone that decmposes chemicals automatically. This project not only does it biologically waiting for a hundreds of years but our solution aims to decomposes with many chemicals. These chemicals can be used multiple times without degradation. Let's discuss swith soime chemicals and their reactions with how their by products are useful</p>
<h2>Photo-Oxidative Degradation</h2>
<p class="white">photo Oxidative degradation involves the method of breaking down plastics in multiple form =s through the combined action of Oxygen and UV light. This process generates some reactive species that attack the polymer chains of the plastics, causing them to break down into smaller products</p>

<h2>Enzymatic Hydrolisis of Plastic</h2>
<p class="white">Enzymatic Hydrolysis uses specific enzymes like PETase, MHETase, to break down polythene Terephthalate(PET) plastics into their monomer components</p>

<h2>Ferric Chloride-Assisted Degradation</h2>
<p class="white">FeCl3 acts as a Catalyst compound here that assists in Degradation process to speed this process into a high fast process.This not just wastes the FeCl3 but this Ctalyast can also be created aain through some other reaction so that this prototype be a cost Effective one.</p>
