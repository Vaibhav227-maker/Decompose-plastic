            <h1 class="blue">What is Plastic?</h1>
            <p class="h"><b>Plastics are a broad category of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that have become indispensable in modern society. These materials are primarily composed of polymersâ€”large molecules made up of repeating structural units called monomers. Polymers can be natural, like cellulose, or synthetic, like polystyrene. The versatility, durability, and cost-effectiveness of plastics have led to their widespread use in various applications, from packaging and construction to electronics and healthcare.</b></p>

<h2 class="blue"><b>History and Development</b><h2>

<p class="h"><b>The history of plastics dates back to the 19th century with the development of Parkesine, the first man-made plastic, invented by Alexander Parkes in 1856. However, it was not until the early 20th century that plastics began to revolutionize industries with the invention of Bakelite in 1907 by Leo Baekeland. This was followed by the development of other important plastics such as polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP).</b></p>
<h2 class="blue"><b>Types of Plastics</b></h2>
<p class="h"><b>Plastics are broadly categorized into thermoplastics and thermosetting plastics:</b><p>
<p class="h"><b>1.Thermoplastics: These plastics become soft when heated and harden upon cooling. They can be remolded and recycled multiple times. Examples include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).</b></p>
<p class="h"><b>2.Thermosetting Plastics: These plastics, once cured, cannot be remolded. They undergo a chemical change during the curing process, making them hard and heat-resistant. Examples include Bakelite, epoxy resins, and melamine.</b></p>
<br>
<b>
<p class="h">Lightweight: Plastics are generally lighter than metals and ceramics.</p>
<p class="h">Durability: They are resistant to corrosion, chemicals, and environmental factors.</p>
<p class="h">Flexibility: Plastics can be molded into various shapes and sizes, allowing for innovative designs.</p>
<p class="h">Insulation: They are excellent insulators of heat and electricity.</p>
<p class="h">Cost-effectiveness: Plastics are relatively inexpensive to produce and process.</p>

<h2 class="blue">Environmental Impact</h2>
            <p class="h">The proliferation of plastics has led to significant environmental concerns, particularly regarding waste management and pollution. Plastics are non-biodegradable, leading to long-term accumulation in landfills and oceans. To mitigate these effects, efforts are being made to improve plastic recycling processes and develop biodegradable alternatives.</p>

            <h2 class="blue">Government Actions</h3>
            <p class="h">The Government of India has implemented several policies to tackle plastic waste management. The Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2024 introduced stricter criteria for biodegradable plastics and targeted microplastics. The *Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)* framework mandates producers to manage the lifecycle of their plastic products, including collection and recycling. The *Swachh Bharat Mission* has also played a significant role in promoting cleanliness and waste segregation. Despite these efforts, challenges remain, such as inadequate waste management infrastructure and enforcement. While these policies are a step in the right direction, more comprehensive measures and stronger enforcement are needed to effectively address the plastic pollution crisis.</p>
